<p>We are proud to announce the establishment of the Tim Odom Foundation, dedicated to honoring the remarkable legacy
    of our dear friend and colleague, Tim Odom.</p>
<p>Tim was not just a colleague, he was a beacon of inspiration and positivity in our lives and in the lives of many
    others. His passion for elevating educational opportunities, improving healthcare outcomes for children, and
    promoting heart and cardiovascular health, along with his commitment to making a difference, left a mark on all
    who knew him.</p>
<p>In memory of Tim and his contributions, we have launched the Tim Odom Foundation with the mission of continuing his
    legacy of kindness, compassion, and dedication to making the world a better place.</p>
<p>The Tim Odom Foundation will focus on three areas that Tim was passionate about: inner-city schools through DC
    Public Schools (DCPS), heart disease research and treatment through the American Heart Association (AHA), and
    healthcare for children through Children's National Hospital (CNH). The Foundation will raise awareness and help
    educate the public in these areas by providing basic equipment and technologies to our youth in DC schools,
    supporting those with cardiovascular diseases, and enabling our youth to enjoy the childhood they deserve.</p>
<p>We invite you to join us in this endeavor. Whether through your support, your participation, or your ideas, we
    believe that together we can carry forward Tim's legacy in a way that truly honors his spirit and the values he
    embodied.</p>

    impactful way.</p>
